### Overview

forage-io is a full-stack mobile app for iOS. The front-end is created using React Native while the back-end is a conglomerate of several AWS technologies (AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB). The purpose of this app is to allow users to generate recipes using their chosen parameters. These parameters include cuisine type, allergies, budget, time needed to prepare, etc. The user may also search through recipes generated by other users and filter them with the previously mentioned parameters. This app will be finished by the end of December, 2023 and will then be published to the iOS app store.
